,,2018,"This is used to ensure the health standard off planting materials. The shoot-tips are cut from the apical shoots of a healthy chrysanthemum plants and inoculated in sterilized bottles containing the culture media. When shoots have developed into plantlets, these are taken out from the laboratory into the greenhouse for acclimatization and hardening, to increase rate of survival and reduce mortality before transplanting.",Abaca,Crops,Agriculture,Products
,,2013,"The formulation produced is a refinement to the existing goat semen extender intended for artificial insemination. Goat sperm cell is characterized as unique to the other livestock sperm cells, in terms of its reaction to the egg yolk. Semen diluents used in processing commonly contain egg yolk as a protection against cold and freezing related damages to the sperm cells. This utility model is comprise of buffer solution, non-penetrating cryoprotectant and penetrating cryoprotectant. The non-penetrating cryoprotectant is a plant based lecithin from soybean to avoid the interaction of the sperm cells and enzyme from the egg yolk. In this case, more sperm cells is ensured alive once introduced into the reproductive tract of the doe. The diluted semen is pack in semen straws and incubated at 5Â°C for four (4) hours. After the incubation period, the semen is slowly plunged into the liquid nitrogen tank. In the assessment of the post-thaw motility of the spermatozoa shows that it increase from 30% to 50%.",Goat,Livestock,Agriculture,Products
,,2016,"The semen extender formulation used in processing goat semen is composed of buffer solution, non-penetrating cryoprotectant and penetrating cryoprotectant.

,,2017,"An efficient rice harvesting implement that can be readily mounted to and dismounted  from the hand tractor unit thus, increasing the utilization of handtractor and helps reduce labor cost. It has an estimated capacity of 0.5 ha/day for an eight-hour operation.","Native Chicken",Livestock,Agriculture,Machinery
,,2015,"Carrageenan is an indigestible polysaccharide (carbohydrates) extracted from edible seaweeds.  Polysaccharide, when subjected to modified irradiation technology, can be an effective plant growth supplement. At a very small dose, this supplement makes an effective organic fertilizer.  It has been found to increase rice yield by 15-30%. The application of three and six bags of chemical fertilizer per ha, combined with 20 ml/L of carrageenan yields higher grain weight (450g and 455 g/10 hills, respectively) than the farmers' practice of applying nine bags of chemical fertilizer/ha.  Carrageenan enhances the crop vigor of rice. Productive tillers and panicle length (length of inflorescence) are significantly higher in Carrageenan-treated plants. Productive tillers are the rice stems that bear panicles (rice inflorescence) with fertilized grains, while longer rice panicle is associated with producing more grains.",Jackfruit,Crops,Agriculture,Machinery
